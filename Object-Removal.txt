This program is the basic version of object removal concept, and implements simple algorithm for simple objects. 
Also one limitation is that it works for only one object removal. In realtime images quality of image differs 
in every frame hence  this program will not give good quality in realtime cases.
The next version of this program will be focused on realtime problems.
This code is compiled in opencv-2.4.6.1
The command to run the program is :
$ ./Object-Removal Landscape_2.jpg Landscape_1.jpg
The output of this code is result.jpg
